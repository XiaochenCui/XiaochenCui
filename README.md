## 🚀 Current Focus: `small-db`

I’m currently building [`small-db`](https://github.com/small-db/small-db) — a personal project that demonstrates the inner workings of a distributed database.

**Core features:**
- 📦 Custom key-value storage layer (inspired by LSM-trees)
- 🌍 Gossip protocol for metadata synchronization
- ⏱️ Hybrid Logical Clocks (HLC)
- 🗳️ Raft-style consensus (WIP)
- 🧪 Catalog, schema, and SQL query layer in progress

This project is designed to explore real-world database internals while staying hackable and understandable.
